# Contribution guide

## Make sure you have a GitHub account, go to our github content repo [blockchain-programming-detached](https://github.com/Zurich-Blockchain-RnD/blockchain-programming-detached), and create a fork, issues or PR

Here's a [quick step by step guide](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940) to making your first open source contribution on github. It's easier than you think. 

When contributing to this repository, please document clearly the change you wish to make. Having a clear idea of how your contribution helps is the first step before trying to add it. Remeber that perfection isn't necessary, that's the magic of open source. Start an idea and watch the rest of the world help you develop it.

## Use a markdown previewer - [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io) is our current favorite
Use this incredibly user friendly editor to write and test how your contribution will looks before pushing your changes. You can automatically create links, quotes and many other elements without knowing anything about markdown.

Our guides are based on the markdown language (MD) which is very simple. You don't need to learn how to use it, just  immitate the rest of the entries in the same document to stay in line with our favorite format. We will try to provide examples at the bottom of each file.

## Read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/Zurich-Blockchain-RnD/ethdocs/blob/master/about/codeofconduct.md)

Assuring a high quality output from our efforts is a foundation for the success of our whole projects. Try to go beyond the basic requirements. The better, the better!
## Pull Request debugging

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
